nCore Doc
=========

This is a small library for documenting the nCore framework. for now, this reproduces functiality already present in the excellent [https://github.com/omarkhan/coffeedoc](coffeedoc), using [https://github.com/sstephenson/eco](eco) and [http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/](Showdown). 

The idea behind it s to develop a component for nCore, which is able to:

* generate documentation for the core files as well for the components
* tightly integrate with the existing nCore commands
* provide an elegant way to integrate static content to the documentation, thereby providing a neat way to generate content for the nCore website.
